            - ACGPMiner: I design and implement ACGPMiner, a parallel algorithm to mine abnormal data in property graphs. ACGPMiner follows the generation-and-validation paradigm and does the anomaly detection level by level.
            - TGDB: I design and implement TGDB, a temporal graph database that efficiently supports temporal data management based on Memgraph. TGDB relies on MVCC to manage temporal data and has advantages with fast querying capabilities and small storage overhead. This work is under submission.
            - Teaching Assistant: 1) Cloud computing and big data: Help students become familiar with the big data processing environment (Hadoop and Spark); 2)
            Introduction to Database System: guide students to design and develop database application platforms.

          We propoese FRM-SE, a convolutional neural network model to tackle the problem of 
          Person Re-identification. I help the teammate Tongkun Xu to design the model and I 
          am mainly responsible for the reproduction of other state-of-the-art methods.
